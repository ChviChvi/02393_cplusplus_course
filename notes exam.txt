make sure, to tell Chat:

-> use the pointer to the object 'this' when possible, to make
explicitly clear that a member variable or function is being accessed, so readability is improved.
-> use the iterator, instead of for each loop
-> comments of what I am doing in the code (i am you in this case.)
